*Hello, my name is Robert Santiago, I was born in Florida but grew up in the Philippine until I was 10 years old in which I moved back to the United Stated in Illinois where I currently reside. Currently I am a student in Iowa State University and my major is Aerospace Engineering*

*Some of my interest in Aerospace are mostly in the field of Aerodynamic Optimization Cases. I really like the analysis part in Engineering and looking at small components and how it effects the whole system* 
# What are you working on? 
*I am working on doing single point and multipoint design in 3D cases and in this case wings in which I used different variables and with those variables used DAFOAM to creat the ideal optimize shape of the wing structure*
# What's your favorite hobby? 
*Some of my hobbies are playing soccer but stopped when I came to college. Right now, one of my main hobbies is dabling in the stock market. I also like doing stuff I like in engineering in my free time like my research and my clubs I am in*
