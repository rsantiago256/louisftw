# Robert Santiago
*Hello, my name is Robert Santiago. I was born in Florida but grew up in the Philippines until I was ten years old, when I moved back to the United States in Illinois, where I currently reside. Currently, I am a student at Iowa State University, and my major is Aerospace Engineering*
# What are you interested in learning? 
*Some of my interests in Aerospace are mostly in the field of Aerodynamic Optimization Cases. I really like the analysis part of Engineering and looking at small components and how it affects the whole system.* 
# What are you working on? 
*I am working on doing single point, and multipoint design in 3D cases, and in this case, wings in which I used different variables and with those variables used DAFOAM to create the ideal optimized shape of the wing structure.*
# What's your favorite hobby? 
*Some of my hobbies are playing soccer, but I stopped when I came to college. One of my main hobbies is dabbling in the stock market. I also like doing stuff I like in engineering in my free time, like my research and the clubs I am in.*
